Dice DataStore is a clean and seamless system designed to let you have the most updated information about all of your data on the client and server at every moment. Dice DataStore is meant to be used for player saving & not standalone data design, though there is a way to set a game-based datastore for things such as bans. This system was designed to create a cache file on the server and update the client with their data at an extremely low-cost networking design which will only update the client with new changes to the players datastore, allowing for an easy-access cache file you can use on the client.
